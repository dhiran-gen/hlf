Learn hlf from basic to advanced

Learning by doing is the best way to master Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Weâ€™ll structure this into a step-by-step roadmap, covering everything from setting up the network to advanced topics.

Hyperledger Fabric Expert Roadmap (With Golang)

Weâ€™ll follow a structured, project-based approach where each step is documented in your GitHub repo.

Phase 1: Setting Up the Network (Basics)
	1.	Understanding HLF Architecture
	â€¢	Orderers, Peers, MSPs, Channels, Chaincode, CouchDB vs LevelDB, etc.
	â€¢	Basic Fabric network components and interactions.
	2.	Deploying a Minimal HLF Network
	â€¢	Using Fabric Samples (test-network)
	â€¢	Writing a simple docker-compose setup (instead of using scripts)
	3.	Bootstrapping a Custom Fabric Network (from scratch)
	â€¢	Generating crypto materials using cryptogen
	â€¢	Creating the configtx.yaml for orderer and peer organizations
	â€¢	Bringing up the network (orderer + peers + CA)
	4.	Creating and Managing Channels
	â€¢	Creating a new channel
	â€¢	Adding peers to a channel
	â€¢	Fetching channel configuration (using configtxlator)

Phase 2: Expanding the Network
	5.	Adding More Peers to an Organization
	â€¢	Peer joining existing org
	â€¢	Handling anchor peer updates
	â€¢	Testing connectivity
	6.	Adding a New Organization to the Network
	â€¢	Modifying configtx.yaml
	â€¢	Generating cryptographic material for the new org
	â€¢	Updating network config and re-generating the genesis block
	7.	Joining a New Organization to an Existing Channel
	â€¢	Fetching channel configuration
	â€¢	Updating config with a new org
	â€¢	Distributing the updated channel config
	8.	Creating Private Data Collections (PDCs) Between Organizations
	â€¢	Defining private data in collections_config.json
	â€¢	Writing chaincode with private collections
	â€¢	Handling endorsement policies for private data

Phase 3: Writing & Deploying Chaincode
	9.	Writing Chaincode in Golang
	â€¢	Writing a basic asset management contract
	â€¢	Deploying chaincode to peers
	â€¢	Invoking transactions and querying data
	10.	Implementing Parent-Child Contracts
	â€¢	Creating hierarchical contracts in chaincode
	â€¢	Interacting between multiple smart contracts
	11.	Implementing Complex Business Logic
	â€¢	Access control using client identity (GetID, GetMSPID)
	â€¢	Writing chaincode with complex endorsement policies
	â€¢	Using CouchDB for rich queries

Phase 4: Scaling & Securing the Network
	12.	Handling Network Upgrades
	â€¢	Chaincode upgrade
	â€¢	Orderer and peer updates
	13.	Using Hyperledger Fabric SDK in Golang
	â€¢	Connecting a Go app to Fabric network
	â€¢	Submitting transactions and querying chaincode
	14.	Deploying Fabric on Kubernetes (K8s)
	â€¢	Converting docker-compose setup to Kubernetes manifests
	â€¢	Running Fabric network in K8s cluster
	15.	Implementing Custom Identity Management
	â€¢	Using external CA (e.g., Vault)
	â€¢	Creating and revoking identities

How Weâ€™ll Proceed
	1.	You will implement each step and document it in GitHub (README, issues, commits).
	2.	If you face an issue, youâ€™ll debug it directly from config/code, then Iâ€™ll guide you further.
	3.	At the end, this repo will be a complete Hyperledger Fabric guide for new joiners.

Let me know if you feel something to add/remove! ðŸš€
